## Linear Regression using Gradient Descent from Scratch
In this repository, I am using a very small dataset of 100 rows with only one dependent variable just to implement gradient descent from scratch.

So we have "Number of hours studied" as dependent variable and "Test score" as dependent variable.

To understand this concept I will recommend you to clear gradient descent concept first to get most out of it.

Watch this video to clear concept : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDv4f4s2SB8

Just implement all those equation into python variable and you will get the concept as well.
